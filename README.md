# A simple buffer overflow exercise
This is a simple exercise to demonstrate how to perform a buffer overflow attack on a vulnerable C program. This was originally done as coursework for software security.

## The Task
Locate the vulnerability in [the program](blame.c) and exploit it.

## Hints
* Turn off some security features (ASLR, etc.)
* Prepare a payload by writing Assembly code and then converting it to Shellcode
* Use the GNU Debugger

## Solution
A full write up can be found [here](Writeup.pdf).
